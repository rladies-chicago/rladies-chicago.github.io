<p>R-Ladies Chicago is excited to start this blog to showcase the perspectives of different members in the R-Ladies Chicago community!</p>
<p>We are looking for individuals who are interested in contributing to this blog. Whether you just want to write a single blog post or contribute regularly, we want to hear from you!</p>
<p>Weâ€™re hoping to have two new posts each month on this blog. Blog posts could consist of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Event Recaps (either an R-Ladies Meetup or Study Group Meeting or another R-related event)<br />
</li>
<li>Learning something new in R (introducing a package or function in R)<br />
</li>
<li>Member profiles (we would love to spotlight members of the R-Ladies Chicago Community)</li>
</ul>
<p>For more details about contributing, please visit our <a href="https://github.com/rladies-chicago/blog">github repo</a>.</p>
<p>If you have any questions, please email us at <a href="mailto:chicago@rladies.org">chicago@rladies.org</a>.</p>
