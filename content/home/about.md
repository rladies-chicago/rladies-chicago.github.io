R-Ladies Chicago was founded in July 2017 with the goal of supporting women and gender minorities who use R. Anyone with an interest in R is welcome - our group includes data scientists, career transitioners, academic researchers, industry experts, students, interested individuals, and others. Whether you're a beginner or an expert, we encourage you to attend a monthly Meetup!  
  
Past R-Ladies events have included R workshops, career panels, networking events, and talks from package developers. If you're interested in sharing your work at a R-Ladies event, we encourage you to reach out to **[chicago@rladies.org](mailto:chicago@rladies.org).**
