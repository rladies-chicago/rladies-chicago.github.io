Curious about package development, but not sure where to start? This workshop is for you! Run by R-Ladies Chicago, the goal of this workshop is to empower you to start contributing back to the R ecosystem with package development. We’ll be using materials developed by Hadley Wickham, Jenny Bryan, and Di Cook for the [Forwards teaching team](https://forwards.github.io/edu/).  
  
By the end of this day-long workshop, you should know how to:  
  
* make your code into an R package,  
* do collaborative coding with GitHub,  
* write a vignette or an article,  
* build a web page for your package, and  
* submit a package to CRAN.  
  
Bring your own code that you want to make into a package, or work with our example.
