Start 2019 the right way! At our January meetup, we'll be recapping [rstudio::conf](http://www.cvent.com/events/rstudio-conf-austin/event-summary-dd6d75526f3c4554b67c4de32aeffb47.aspx), an annual conference about all things R and RStudio! Organizers will give 10-minute lightning talks on a cool topic or tool they learned about at the conference.   
  
If you are/have attended rstudio::conf and would like to give a lightning talk, please email us at chicago [at] rladies.org.  
  
Please RSVP on our [Meetup Page](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-chicago/events/257346957/)!
