We will taste some wines (and non-alcoholic drinks too!) and rate them based on the winemag.com scoring system. Then, we will work together in small groups to analyze and visualize the wine preferences of R-Ladies in R! Wine is absolutely optional --we'll have non-alcoholic beverages & food too.  
  
We'll also be introducing some R-Ladies Chicago outreach initiatives, including our new website: rladieschicago.org and kicking-off our Random Acts of Coffee program!  
  
There will be no formal technical talk at this meeting; rather, a time to network with fellow R-Ladies while doing a collaborative coding activity. This is part of our “social” Meetups, focused on networking and idea exchange.  
  
Please RSVP on the Meetup page and let us know if you have any questions!
