Celebrate Halloween with an R-Ladies Chicago Hacktoberfest!

**What we'll do:**  
We'll contribute to open source projects on GitHub while snacking on fall-themed treats! Costumes are encouraged!

We'll open some issues in our [organization repo](https://github.com/rladies-chicago). Complexity will range from *very* beginner-friendly to intermediate. We'll then work together to make some pull requests (PRs). We're open to any contributions: from fixing a typo on our website to adding a tutorial to our R-beginners repo!  
  
If you are working on a project that you would like contributions to, let us know and we'll add it to our list!  

Learn more about DigitalOcean's global Hacktoberfest [here](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/).  

  
  
  
**Please note:**    
Our primary mission is to encourage more women and non-binary individuals to get involved in the R community. *As such, we strongly encourage that all men who attend this event have a female or non-binary sponsor, as spots may be limited. Please contact chicago@rladies.org if you have questions.*  
    
  
  
Please RSVP through [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-chicago/events/265379879/).
