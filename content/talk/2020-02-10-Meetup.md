## About  
  
Hashtag TidyTuesday is a weekly social data project focused on using tidyverse packages to clean, wrangle, tidy, and plot a new dataset every Tuesday.  

We will be using a dataset from the [TidyTuedsay Github](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday)
that has been tamed, but does not always adhere to “tidy” data principles. Our goal is to have you take a look at the raw data, and generate either a copy of the original plot or a novel take on the data! You can obviously use whatever techniques you feel are appropriate, but the data will be organized in a way that tidyverse tools will work well!  

    
## What to bring  
  
Yourself! And a laptop - this will be an interactive event.

  
  
**Please note:**    
Our primary mission is to encourage more women and non-binary individuals to get involved in the R community. *As such, we strongly encourage that all men who attend this event have a female or non-binary sponsor, as spots may be limited. Please contact chicago@rladies.org if you have questions.*
