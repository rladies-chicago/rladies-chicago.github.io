R-Ladies Board Member Katherine Simeon will give a talk on text analysis in R using a year's worth of @WeAreRLadies tweets!

[@WeAreRLadies](https://twitter.com/WeAreRLadies) is the rotating curation account (RoCur) for R-Ladies Global. Each week, an awesome R-Lady takes over the account to talk about their work and perspectives in R. Katherine is the founder and admin of the @WeAreRLadies Twitter account showcasing R-Ladies in statistics, data science, and more!
