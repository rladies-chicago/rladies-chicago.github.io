We'll be welcoming guests to Chicago for our [Women's Package Development Workshop](https://forwards.github.io/edu/chicago/). Join us for a happy hour to socialize with fellow female and non-binary R users from Chicago and beyond!  
  
We'll be meeting up at [Motor Row Brewing](https://www.motorrowbrewing.com/). This casual get-together is open to any *female or non-binary* individuals, regardless if you are attending the package workshop.  
    
RSVP on our [Meetup Page](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-chicago/events/258562339/).
