      <description>Our first 2019 Meetup was a series of lightning talks based on what we learned at rstudio::conf2019. This year, six R-Ladies Chicago members were at rstudio::conf (and we met even more attendees from Chicago!). Overall, the conference was inspiring and we are excited to use what we learned to host great events for R-Ladies Chicago in 2019!
Florencia Mangini wrote a great blog post recapping our meetup. Be sure to check it out!</description>

      <title>Introducing Chicago Schools Enrollment Data to R</title>
      <link>/post/2019-01-21-mack/</link>

      <description>The City of Chicago and Chicago Public Schools (CPS) have made data on annual enrollments, school locations, and other school features available to the public. After a bit of wrangling (frankly maybe more than just a bit) these data can be used in R to get key visualizations.
My own interest in the schools data began with a desire to understand more about the spread of charter schools in the city, and also more about the sharp enrollment declines that some regular public high schools have experienced since the early ’00s.</description>

      <description>At R-Ladies, we want everyone to feel welcome, especially women and minority genders. Our favorite part of R-Ladies is cultivating an inclusive learning community–it is a challenge, but well worth it. As an R Community, where we are passionate about what we do in R, accessibility and inclusivity also means cultivating a welcoming environment for R users of all levels–from beginner to expert to everyone in between.
The Chicago organizing team works hard to plan our events intentionally where there is a combination of tutorials, talks about specific topics, and social events that showcase the strengths and address the interests of the local R-Ladies community.</description>
